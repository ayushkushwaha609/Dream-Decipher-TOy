    <p>Greetings Folks,
        <br>
       I am currently developing the backend infrastructure for my project "DREAM DECIPHER" that let's users find meaning of their weird dreams.
       <br> 
       <br>
       I apologize for the delay in submiting the week2 update @nights&weekends, as I was unable to do so due to some unforseen circumstances.
       <br>
       <br>
       But, I assure you that I haven't stopped building.
       <br>
       <br>
       My progress may be slow because I am learning the required skills on-the-go as I make this website.
       <br>
       <br>
       I will keep updating my blog frequently with new posts and updates.
       <br>
       <br>
       For the time being You all can <b><a href="https://forms.fillout.com/t/fAYBGzCjwXus"></a>Send your Dreams</a></b> and I'll decode it for you and send it to your email.
       <br>
       <br>
       THANK YOU.

    </p>
